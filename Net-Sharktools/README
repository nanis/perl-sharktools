Net-Sharktools version 0.001
============================

C<Net::Sharktools> is an adaptation of the Python interface provided with the
C<Sharktools> package which is a "small set of  tools that allow use of
Wireshark's deep packet inspection capabilities in interpreted programming
languages."

Sharktools can be obtained obtained Armen Babikyan's web site at
L<http://www.mit.edu/~armenb/sharktools/>. To use C<Net::Sharktools>, you must
first build the Sharktools C library successfully as described in the README
for the Sharktools package (the version of this file bundled with Sharktools
v.0.1.5 is included in this module for your reference).

C<Net::Sharktools> is almost a direct translation of the Python interface
C<pyshark> included with Sharktools.

INSTALLATION

Sharktools is closely coupled with the internals of Wireshark. Before
attempting to build C<Net::Sharktools>, you should ensure that you are able to
build and run the Python module C<pyshark> distributed with Sharktools. Note
that you should use C<python2> to test C<pyshark>.

The build process for Sharktools requires you to install Wireshark and also
have the full source tree for Wireshark accessible. You will need the same to
build Sharktools as well.

Currently, the C<Makefile.PL> for C<Net::Sharktools> makes not attempt to
automatically deduce the locations for your WireShark and Sharktools
distributions. You will need to edit C<Makefile.PL> to point both the compiler
and linker to the correct locations.

During development, I used the following directory tree:

$HOME/sharktools/wireshark-1.4.2

$HOME/sharktools/sharktools-0.1.5

$HOME/sharktools/perlshark/Net-Sharktools

and put in C<Makefile.PL>

    LIBS  => [ join ' ', (
        "-L$ENV{HOME}/sharktools/sharktools-0.1.5/src", qw(
        -L/usr/lib
        -lsharktools
        -lglib-2.0
        -lwireshark -lwiretap -lwsutil
    ))],
and

    INC => join(' ', qw(
        -I.
        -I/usr/include/glib-2.0
        -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include
    ),  "-I$ENV{HOME}/sharktools/wireshark-1.4.2",
        "-I$ENV{HOME}/sharktools/wireshark-1.4.2/wiretap",
        "-I$ENV{HOME}/sharktools/sharktools-0.1.5/src",
    ),

Once you have those paths set up, you can do

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/install/path
    make
    make test
    make install
